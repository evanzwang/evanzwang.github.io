Hi! I'm Evan Wang, a current freshman at UMD studying computer science.
I am interested in algorithms and computation, artificial intelligence, and intelligence/cognition in general.
My broader motivation is an urge to help advance humanity (primarily in technological developments) mainly because:

1. Future technology is always exciting.
2. Advancements typically lead to quality of life improvements for those that will come after us.

I believe advancements in computer science has a massive potential to propel humanity forward. *As a side note, I also think developments into space is another thrilling direction for society to pursue!*

Outside of traditional academics, I enjoy playing volleyball, reading, playing piano, and producing music (occasionally).

On this website, you can find previous projects I've been a part of, my resume, and some music that I've made in the past.
