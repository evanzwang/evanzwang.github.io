## Involvements with Music

I was first introduced to music around 5 years old, when my parents took me to my first piano lesson. The piano has been part of my life since then. I've played some other instruments like violin, voice, guitar, and recorder (how could I forget the recorder!), but I dropped them for some reason or another. (I also DJ'ed for a while; not sure if that counts as an instrument.)

I started producing music in my sophomore year of high school, using FL Studio as my DAW. For those that are unfamiliar, a DAW (digital audio workstation) is a piece of software that allows you to "make music" and process audio efficiently. After one and a half years, I switched DAWs to Ableton Live, which I use currently.

## Influences

I've generally produced hip-hop and electronic genres of music, which is what I enjoyed listening to for a while now. Lately, more Japanese (J-pop) and Korean (K-pop) songs have found their way into my playlists, which tend to have many influences coming from all parts of the world. The J-pop music I listen to have a mixture of both rock and jazz, while the K-pop I listen to is more electronic with elements of Western pop and hip-hop. One of my latest projects drew inspiration from modern K-pop styles, and in the future, I plan to include J-pop features into my music.

Some of my past and current favorite artists I draw inspiration from are (in no particular order):
Illenium,
Lil Uzi Vert,
Yoasobi,
Porter Robinson,
Yorushika,
Migos,
Twice,
Seven Lions,
Blackpink,
and a lot more.
