LAY'S CHIPS


VERSE 1 (Evan Wang):
Yeah, this is linear algebra
Basic equations locked up, and
Boxed up, into many vectors
Values of solutions and the factors

X-one, x-two, x-three: (3d)
Add em up, and what do they be
Variables are basic or free
No pivot column? Just set it to free

Matrices got their own operations
Look at their really cool multiplication
Ain't communtative unlike temptation
M by n times n by p dimensions

Square matrices, taking the inverse
For 2 by 2 you know the method is terse
It does not hurt, if its invertible
Since by identity it is convertible 

Now we move to the determinants
It’s not that hard to determine it
Do the cofactor expansion, with
No derivatives nor any tangents

On paper, go look for rows of zeros
They will be your ultimate heroes
On a computer reduce the rows
Big O of n-cubed with the diagonals (no factorial)


CHORUS (Chad Yu):
When you got Lay, you dont need no tutor, cause
There are online answers, but that's just a rumor
Programming with MatLab on a computer
Don’t use any paper cause we are not boomers

3 equations, into 1 box
From long to short, just like my talks
Modelling things like shops and stocks
I guess matrices really just do rock


VERSE 2 (Alan Chen):
Take the span, where does it go (where)
It produces a subspace in 'da flow (in 'da flow)
Dependent vectors don't change it on 'da low (on 'da low)
So they can just be dropped out 'da show (out 'da show)

Aye, these basics of bases
Independent vectors 'gon serve as the laces
N vectors make N dimensional spaces
No more no less, and they all wrapped in their braces

Aye, yeah we’re going eigen-style,
Gotta remember basic algebra, it’s been a while
A minus lamda I, then set determinant to zero
This what Tony Stark did, now you’re an eigen-hero

When you’re past the basics
Get the characteristic equation,
2 by 2 its a quadratic equation
Got the eigenvalues, they reveal the transformation
Constant multiple of the vector by the matrix


CHORUS (Chad Yu):
When you got Lay, you dont need no tutor, cause
There are online answers that's just a rumor
Programming with MatLab on a computer
Don’t use any paper cause we are not boomers

3 equationsm into 1 box
From long to short, just like my talks
Modelling things like shops and stocks
I guess matrices really just do rock
